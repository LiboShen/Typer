# Vision

## Our Vision

To make voice-controlled computing accessible, trustworthy, and natural for
everyone.

## Concrete Vision

Imagine a world where people naturally complete their work by combining voice
and touch:

- A writer drafts their novel by speaking while occasionally tapping to format
  or edit
- A developer builds apps by speaking code constructs while pointing to where
  they should go
- A business analyst fills complex forms by touching fields and speaking their
  content
- An artist controls their tools through a mix of voice commands and gesture
  controls

This hybrid interaction becomes so natural that people forget they're "operating
a computer" - they're simply creating and working as intuitively as having a
conversation.

## What Success Looks Like

1. **User Experience**

   - Voice commands become a primary interface choice, not just an alternative
   - Users seamlessly switch between voice and traditional inputs
   - Complex workflows are simplified through voice interactions

2. **Trust & Privacy**

   - Full transparency in how voice data is processed
   - Users have complete control over their voice data
   - Open-source codebase that's community-verified

3. **Community & Ecosystem**

   - Thriving marketplace of community-created workflows
   - De facto standard for voice-based development
   - Active contributor base for continuous improvement

## Why Now

- Advanced open-source speech recognition (like Whisper) is production-ready
- Computing power is abundant and affordable:
  - Consumer devices can handle local processing
  - Cloud computing costs are negligible
- This enables flexible deployment choices without compromising privacy

## Other Notes

- Consider expanding to other languages beyond English
- Future potential for accessibility applications
- Watch for emerging voice interaction standards
- Keep monitoring enterprise vs. consumer adoption patterns
