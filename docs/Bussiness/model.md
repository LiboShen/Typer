Last Updated: 2024-12-23

## Core Principles

- Build trust through open-source and local-first approach
- Monetize through genuine value-add cloud features
- Keep operations lean and automated
- Transparent pricing and data handling

## Revenue Model

### Free Tier (Local Only)

- Complete local speech-to-text using Whisper
- Basic command processing with local LLM
- All core text editing features
- Local data storage only
- Open-source codebase

### Pro Tier ($X/month)

- Cloud API access for:
  - Faster processing
  - Higher accuracy models
  - Advanced command processing
- (Potentially) Cross-device sync

## Pricing Strategy

1. **Initial Phase (First 6 Months)**
   - Focus on free tier adoption
   - Collect usage patterns
   - Build trust and brand

2. **Pro Tier Launch**
   - Start with simple per-user pricing
   - Target $15-20/month range
   - Or usage-based pricing
   - Annual plans with discount

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs
- Development tools
- Website hosting
- Basic infrastructure

### Variable Costs (Pro Tier)
- API computing resources
- Storage for sync features
- Support time
- Payment processing fees

## Growth Strategy

1. **Trust Building (Now)**
   - Perfect the free (local or little remote) experience
   - Build community around open-source
   - Document everything about data handling

2. **Monetization (Later)**
   - Launch Pro tier when we have:
     - 1000+ active users
     - Clear user demand for cloud features
     - Proven value proposition

## Other Notes

- Consider enterprise licensing later
- Watch for opportunities in API reselling (wholesales)
- Monitor computing costs closely
- Keep tracking user requests for cloud features
